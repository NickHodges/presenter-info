## :dancer: My deliveries at your event

Here's what I will do when invited as a presenter at your event.

- [x] **Deliver a fitting talk for the intended audience.** I tend to deliver a unique talk every time I can and it will be an up-to-date talk.
- [x] **Deliver the talk on time and sticking to the defined format and duration.** I need to know what time frame you expect and what format you want it to be in. I will show up at the times you need me to be there and set up on stage with enough time for AV people to wire up microphones and other equipment.
- [x] **Be available for conference attendees.** Conferences to me are more about the people than about the content. Therefore I will try to be there for questions and feedback.
- [x] **Be available for other promotional parts of the event.** I am happy to do interviews or give you feedback to use in conference wrap-ups
- [x] **Promote my presence at your event.** I will tweet and blog before, during and after the event about what I will do at your event and interesting things I encounter.
- [x] **Publish my slides and screen recording after my talk.** If there is a good enough connection, this normally happens right after the presentation. Everything I create at your event will be licensed Creative Commons unless otherwise agreed.

## :computer: My setup

I am pretty open to different ways of presenting, but here is my perfect setup

- [x] I like to use my own computer as I have them set up the way I need and there may be coding examples.
- [x] I either use a Surface Book or a Macbook Pro. Both come with Mini Display Ports but I also carry a dongle to connect to HDMI.
- [x] I only send slides in advance when there is live translation or signing. Then I will also have a list of terms to translate and put some time aside with the translators to go through the deck.

If I need to use a central computer instead of mine, please consider the following:

- [x] My slides are in PowerPoint and 16:9 format. I will have them on a memory stick with the needed fonts.
- [x] I don't use any audio or video in my slides, but some GIF animations.
- [x] I normally don't need notes, but I want to have a remote clicker and a "nanny screen" where I can see my slides instead of having to refer to the screen behind me.

## :pray: My expectations

I am a professional presenter, and will do a lot to ensure that the event will be a success. As such, I have a few expections I want met:

- [ ] **Provide me with a prime speaking slot.** I've proven to be a good keynote speaker and find interesting topics to open or close conferences.
- [ ] **Deliver a professional stage setup.** I bring my own laptop and connectors, but I expect at least a power plug and a microphone. I am very good with audio engineers (having been one myself) but I am not there to fix audio issues or set up projectors. I expect this to work and be available. I normally don't need an internet connection, but would love to have one.
- [ ] **Record and publish my talk.** Recordings are a great advertisement for your conference and I make sure my presentations make sense without being in the room.
- [ ] **Keep me out of sponsorship discussions.** I am at your event as Chris and to present. I will not "pay to play" and I won't speak at sponsored speaking slots. I am happy to provide you with contacts of who to invite instead. I am also happy to introduce you to company colleagues dealing with sponsorships, but this is not - at all - what I do. If you are looking for a corporate sponsoring to sell speaking slots, please don't contact me.

## :money_with_wings: Cost and payments/expenses

I am in the lucky position that I have a job that allows me to present. That doesn't mean though that I want to be a "cheaper" option and stand in the way of people who live off presenting.

- [ ] **I don't expect to be paid for my presentations if your conference helps me in my work.** However, to ensure I don't under-bid peers, I'd like conferences to offer free diversity tickets for the value of a speaker fee instead.
- [ ] **If possible, I'd like you to cover my travel and hotel.** I am on stage and need to be able to concentrate on that. I can not do so if I need to find lodgings and organise travel to your event in addition to presenting. I don't expect first class or business class flights, but I do expect to arrive a day before the event and leave the day after with lodging organised in between. I do not want to book and pay myself and get reimbursed. International payments are a mess and I don't have time to deal with paper work in between events seeing that I am presenting almost every two weeks. I am sorry if that sounds harsh, but I want to concentrate on my talks, not try to explain to the tax department what all these invoices are about.

There are always options to haggle about these things. I'm a reasonable person and if you spend your time creating a great event where money isn't your main goal, we'll find a way.

## :boom: Things can go wrong...

Even with the best intentions, there may be trouble and I might not be available for your event. You may also change your mind. If that happens, here's what I want to happen.

- [x] When I can not attend for some reason or another, I will make very much sure to find a replacement presenter to fill in for me. I have a vast network of peers, mentees and friends who can help out.
- [x] When for some reason you decide to slash my speaking slot, I expect you to cover the cost involved for me. Often I can book my own flights as I book other appointments around events. Many of them aren't refundable.
