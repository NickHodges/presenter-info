## :collision: Stuff I Like in a Conference

Here are a few things I like to see in a conference:

  ✅: I prefer to attend a conference in person, but virtual conferences are 100% okay during this strange time we live in.
  ✅: I like a conference committed to diversity in speakers and attendees.
  ✅: I like a conference with a strong Code of Conduct that ensures a great experience for everyone.

## :dancer: My deliveries at your event

Here's what I will do when invited as a presenter at your event.

- [x] **Deliver a fitting talk for the intended audience.** I tend to deliver a unique talk every time I can and it will be an up-to-date talk.
- [x] **Deliver the talk on time and sticking to the defined format and duration.** I need to know what time frame you expect and what format you want it to be in. I will show up at the times you need me to be there and set up on stage with enough time for AV people to wire up microphones and other equipment.
- [x] **Be available for conference attendees.** Conferences to me are more about the people than about the content. Therefore I will try to be there for questions and feedback.
- [x] **Be available for other promotional parts of the event.** I am happy to do interviews or give you feedback to use in conference wrap-ups
- [x] **Promote my presence at your event.** I will tweet and blog before, during and after the event about what I will do at your event and interesting things I encounter.
- [x] **Publish my slides and screen recording after my talk.** If there is a good enough connection, this normally happens right after the presentation. Everything I create at your event will be licensed Creative Commons unless otherwise agreed.
